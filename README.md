# Nono (the small discord bot)

![Nono](image.png)

Nono is a Python discord bot message functions and reaction tracking.
This project is mostly a test to mess around with the discord.py library and some python features. It's somewhat broken so you shouldn't try to use it.
It might be somewhat devent as a template for future projects tho.

The project follows the [gazr](https://gazr.io) specs. To launch it, make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed and just do `make run`.
